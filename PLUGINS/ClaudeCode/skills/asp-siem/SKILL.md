# ASP SIEM

This skill provides SIEM search and investigation capabilities for the Agentic SOC Platform.

## Available Operations

Ask the user which operation they want to perform:

1. **Keyword search** - Search logs by IP, hostname, username, hash, or any arbitrary keyword across one or more SIEM
   indices

This skill currently focuses on `siem_keyword_search`. More SIEM operations can be added later using the same structure.

## Operation Details

### 1. Keyword Search

**Required parameters:**

- `keyword` - Search keyword or keyword list. Can be an IP address, hostname, username, email, hash, process name, domain, or any string. If a list is provided, all keywords are matched with AND semantics
- `time_range_start` - Start time in UTC ISO8601 format, for example `2026-02-04T06:00:00Z`
- `time_range_end` - End time in UTC ISO8601 format, for example `2026-02-04T07:00:00Z`

**Optional parameters:**

- `time_field` - Time field used for the range filter. Default is `@timestamp`. Common alternatives include
  `event.created` and `_time`
- `index_name` - Target SIEM index/source name. If omitted, search across all available indices and backends. If
  provided, search only that specific index

**Process:**

1. Collect the keyword and time range from the user
2. If the user knows the target data source, collect `index_name`; otherwise leave it empty for cross-index search
3. If the target source uses a non-default time field, collect `time_field`; otherwise use `@timestamp`
4. Use MCP tool `siem_keyword_search` with the collected parameters
5. Check the returned `status` for each result group
6. If the result is too large, reduce the time range or add more precise keywords so the query moves from `summary` or `sample` toward `full`
7. If the result is empty or too narrow, expand the time range or remove restrictive keywords
8. Continue iterating until `full` is reached when the goal is to retrieve the complete original raw logs
9. Parse each returned JSON string
10. If the result list is empty after reasonable refinement, state that no matching logs were found in the specified time range
11. Present results grouped by backend and index when multiple results are returned

**Behavior notes:**

- If `index_name` is not provided, the tool searches across available ELK and Splunk indices
- A keyword list uses AND semantics, so adding keywords reduces result volume and removing keywords broadens the search
- The tool returns adaptive results based on hit volume:
    - `full` - complete matching records for smaller result sets
    - `sample` - statistics plus representative sample records for medium result sets
    - `summary` - statistics only for large result sets
- Use time range changes together with keyword changes to control result volume and converge on `full`
- The preferred end state for evidence collection is `full`, because it contains the complete original raw logs returned by the backend
- Time values must be UTC and end with `Z`

**Refinement guidance:**

1. Start with the strongest known keyword and a reasonable time window
2. If the search returns `summary`, narrow the time window or add more keywords
3. If the search returns `sample`, inspect the sample and statistics, then refine again if full logs are required
4. If the search returns `full`, use those records as the complete raw log set for that query
5. If the search is empty, expand the time window or remove one keyword from the AND list

**Output format:**

**Search Overview**

- Keyword
- Keyword count and whether AND semantics were used
- Time range start/end
- Time field
- Searched index or `all indices`
- Total result groups

**Per Result Group**

- Backend
- Index distribution
- Status
- Total hits
- Message

**Statistics**

- For each field statistic: field name and top values with counts

**Sample Records**

- Show representative records when `records` is not empty
- Prefer highlighting timestamp, source index, host, user, IP, process, event/action, and other directly relevant fields
  when present

**Suggested rendering:**

| Backend | Status | Total Hits | Index Distribution | Message |
|---------|--------|------------|--------------------|---------|
| ...     | ...    | ...        | ...                | ...     |

Then provide statistics and sample records under each result group.

## Usage Flow

1. Ask user which SIEM operation they want to perform
2. Collect required parameters for the chosen operation
3. Execute the appropriate MCP tool
4. Format and present the results according to the operation's output specification
5. Handle errors gracefully, such as invalid UTC time format, unsupported index, backend connection issues, or no matching logs
